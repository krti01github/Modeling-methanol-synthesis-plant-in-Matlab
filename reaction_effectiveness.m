% Function for calculating the reaction effectiveness factor from 
% [Lommerts 2000].
% Represents diffusion limitations due to large catalyst particles
% slowing the reaction, compared to if the catalyst was very fine.
% eta_reac â‚¬ [0, 1], 0 stops reaction, 1 no limitation 
% and is calculated for each reaction.
